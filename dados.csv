 A PRECURSOR TO THE RELATIONAL EVALUATION PROCEDURE: SEARCHING FOR THE CONTEXTUAL CUES THAT CONTROL EQUIVALENCE RESPONDING,"stimulus equivalence, go/no-go successive discrimination, matching to sample, response
interval, adult humans","The precursor to the relational evaluation procedure (pREP) is a go/no-go successive discrimination procedure for examining stimulus equivalence. Previous research has shown that it does not readily produce equivalence responding unless some matching-to-sample (MTS) procedures are incorporated into the experimental sequence. Two experiments attempted to identify contextual cues that would generate equivalence responding on the pREP. Experiment 1 examined the effects of using abstract symbols or various verbal labels as response options on the pREP. Only the words same and different, when used as response options, reliably produced equivalence responding across 4 subjects. Experiment 2 examined different pretraining preparations designed to attach the functions of the words same and different to abstract symbols that could then be used as response options on the pREP. The most effective pretraining procedure involved multiple-exemplar training during which subjects were trained to respond to abstract symbols in the presence of pairs of stimuli that were either formally the same or different. The abstract symbols were subsequently used as response options with the pREP, and all subjects reliably demonstrated equivalence responding. The findings suggest that the relations of same and different may be fundamental to equivalence responding. These findings are discussed in terms of what they suggest about the nature of the equivalence phenomenon specifically and derived relational responding more generally."
Derived Relational Networks and Control by Novel Instructions: A Possible Model of Generative Verbal Responding,,"Relational Frame Theory proposes that control by novel instructions may be understood as control by networks of Same and Before or After relations. The current paper reports two experiments in which such control was demonstrated. In Experiment 1, undergraduate students were first trained to respond in accordance with Before and After relations and then trained to respond in accordance with Same and Different relations. Subjects were then presented with a number of 'instructions' in the form of networks of Same, Different, Before, and After relations in the absence of reinforcement. Of the 3 students, 2 demonstrated the required performance within two exposures to the final phase of the experiment. In Experiment 2, 5 of 8 additional subjects who demonstrated instructional control also did so in the presence of 24 novel stimulus sets without further training. The implications of these novel and generative performances for the analysis of instructional control and human language more generally are considered. "
Assessing stimulus equivalence with a precursor to the relational evaluation procedure,"Stimulus equivalence, Go/no-go successive discrimination, Matching to sample, Test protocol, Adult humans","Previous research has demonstrated that, after being trained on multiple match-to-sample (MTS) tasks (A–B, B–C), most human adults respond in accordance with symmetry (B–A, C–B) and equivalence (C–A) when measured with MTS tests and with a precursor to the Relational Evaluation Procedure (pREP). The latter procedure involves conditional go/no-go discrimination tasks, requiring subjects to press a bar during a 5 s interval after the successive presentation of two same-class stimuli, and not to press after the presentation of two different-class stimuli (e.g. Ci → Ai → press, Ci → Aj → no press). The present study was an effort to replicate these findings. The study consisted of five experiments. Very few subjects evidenced pREP symmetry and equivalence unless they had (a) already demonstrated symmetry and equivalence in a MTS test before, or (b) received pREP pretraining with unrelated stimulus pairs and symmetry was tested before equivalence. Failures to show symmetry were always associated with pressing at or close to 50% of these trials. Failures to show equivalence were associated with pressing or not pressing on (almost) all trials. Current findings are similar to those obtained in equivalence studies involving MTS probes permitting the subjects not to respond to the designated comparisons."
A functional-analytic model of analogy using the Relational Evaluation Procedure,,"Analogical reasoning is conceptualized by Relational Frame Theory as responding in accordance with an equivalence relation between equivalence or other types of derived stimulus relations. The purpose of this study was to provide an empirical demonstration of analogy using the Relational Evaluation Procedure (REP), a recently developed technique for the rapid training and testing of derived stimulus relations. The experiment involved 9 stages in which 5 adult male subjects were exposed to a complex series of REP training and testing protocols, by the end of which they each readily demonstrated 24 completely novel instances of responding in accordance with analogical relations as conceptualized by RFT. The implications of these results for future functional analytic inveshgations of analogical reasoning are discussed. "
"Implementación del precursor del procedimiento de evaluación relacional en el establecimiento de marcos relacionales de igualdad, oposición y diferencia","matching to sample, relational responding, relational frame theory, VisualBasic®, stimulus equivalence","The present study examined the degree to which relational responding in accordance with sameness, opposition, and distinction could emerge using a precursor to the relational evaluation procedure (pPER). Fifteen adult human participants engaged in a computerized experiment consisting of a variety of trained and tested conditional discriminations. First, participants were shown two stimulus objects on the computer screen and were asked to choose between two arbitrary colored response options that functioned to describe the above stimuli as “same”, “opposite”, or “different”. Second, participants were tested on the symmetrical relations they were initially trained on, as well as novel stimuli pairs that were functionally equivalent to the trained stimuli. All participants were able to perform at high levels of accuracy during testing with either previously trained or novel stimulus items. The present data suggest that non-matching to sample means of establishing relational responding to same, difference, and opposite stimuli are possible and should be explored in greater detail than reported in the published literature."
Establishing and Reversing Equivalence Relations with a Precursor to the Relational Evaluation Procedure.,,"Previous studies have investigated the viability of a go/ no-go discrimination procedure (pREP) for generating stimulus equivalence. During pREP training, participants receive positive feedback for pressing a bar after the successive presentation of two same-class stimuli and for not pressing after the presentation of two different-class stimuli. During pREP testing, the procedures are the same but without feedback. The results of that research consistently indicated that pREP training (Ai-+Bi-+press, AiBj-+no press, Bi-+Ci-+press, Bi-+Cj-+no press) produces pREP symmetry (e.g., Bi-+Ai-+press, Bi-+Aj-+no press) but not pREP equivalence (Ci-+Ai-+press, Ci-+Aj-+no press) unless equivalence had already been demonstrated with match-to-sample (MTS), or the pREP was converted into a MTS task with the stimulus pairs as samples and the words SAME and DIFFERENT as comparisons. The present study examined if the efficacy of the pREP could be improved while leaving the go/no-go structure intact. The study consists of six experiments. The results indicated that the pREP had one, possibly two weaknesses. First, during testing, it permitted nondifferential responding. Second, during training, the contingencies permitted class ambiguity, that is, class formation based on pressing (Ai-Bi-Ci) or on not pressing (Ai-Bj-Ci). When measures were taken to discourage nondifferential responding (instruction to press on 50% of the trials, using a simple-to-complex test protocol) and to reduce ambiguity (feedback for pressing only), the pREP not only produced equivalence bUit also equivalence reversal in (almost) all participants."
TRANSFORMATION OF AVOIDANCE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAME AND OPPOSITE RELATIONAL FRAMES,"avoidance, transformation of functions, same, opposite, relational frame theory, human adults","Research on the emergence of human avoidance behavior in the absence of direct contact with an aversive event is somewhat limited. Consistent with work on derived relational responding, the present study sought to investigate the transformation of avoidance response functions in accordance with the relational frames of Same and Opposite. Participants were first exposed to nonarbitrary and arbitrary relational training and testing in order to establish Same and Opposite relations among arbitrary stimuli. The training tasks were; Same–A1–B1, Same–A1–C1, Opposite–A1–B2, Opposite–A1–C2. Next, all possible combinatorially entailed (i.e., B–C and C–B) relations were tested. During the avoidanceconditioning phase, one stimulus (B1) from the relational network signaled a simple avoidance response that cancelled a scheduled presentation of an aversive image and sound. All but one of the participants who met the criteria for conditioned avoidance also demonstrated derived avoidance by emitting the avoidance response in the presence of C1 and the nonavoidance response in the presence of C2. Control participants who were not exposed to relational training and testing did not show derived avoidance. Implications of the findings for understanding clinically significant avoidance behavior are discussed."
Derived avoidance learning: Transformation of avoidance response functions in accordance with same and opposite relational frames,,"Two experiments were designed to replicate and extend previous findings on the transformation of avoidance response functions in accordance with the relational frames of Same and Opposite. Participants were first exposed to nonarbitrary and arbitrary relational training and testing. Next, during avoidance conditioning, one stimulus from the relational network signaled a simple avoidance response that cancelled a scheduled presentation of an aversive image and sound. The majority of participants who met the criteria for conditioned avoidance also demonstrated derived avoidance. Experiment 1 showed that detailed instructions were not necessary for derived transformation to occur. Experiment 2 showed that more complex patterns of transformation may emerge when another stimulus from the relational network signaled the avoidance response. Implications for understanding clinically significant avoidance behavior are discussed."
EQUIVALENCE CLASS FORMATION IN A TRACE STIMULUS PAIRING TWO-RESPONSE FORMAT: EFFECTS OF RESPONSE LABELS AND PRIOR PROGRAMMED TRANSITIVITY INDUCTION,"equivalence classes, trace stimulus-pairing two-response trial format, successive matching trial format, generalized transitivity repertoire, keyboarding, college students","Three experiments identified factors that did and did not enhance the formation of two-node fourmember equivalence classes when training and testing were conducted with trials presented in a trace stimulus pairing two-response (SP2R) format. All trials contained two separately presented stimuli. Half of the trials, called within-class trials, contained stimuli from the same class while the other half, called cross class trials, contained stimuli from different classes. On within class trials, making a YES response was correct and making a NO response was wrong. On cross class trials, making a NO response was correct and making a YES response was wrong. In Experiment 1, similar intermediate percentages of participants (about 50%) formed classes, regardless of whether the responses were labeled YES and NO or SAME and DIFF. Response labeling thus did not influence class formation. Regardless of response labels, failures of class formation were primarily due to failure of class-indicative responding produced by within-class transitivity probes. In Experiment 2, only 50% of participants formed classes without prior training, as in Experiment 1, but 100% of participants formed equivalence classes after the establishment of a generalized transitivity repertoire by use of a programmed transitivity induction protocol. Experiment 3 examined two components of the programmed transitivity induction protocol and found that the exclusion of AC trials had no effect on the percentage of participants who formed equivalence classes, while presenting the stimulus sets in randomized order interfered with equivalence class formation. A further analysis found that a number of stimulus control topographies differentiated between individuals who did and did not form equivalence classes. In general, then, these experiments demonstrate that equivalence classes can be formed reliably when training and testing are conducted in an SP2R format, supporting the view that equivalence class formation can account for the development of conceptual categories in natural settings."
A Sketch of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and the Relational Elaboration and Coherence (REC) Model,"Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure, relational frame theory, network, elaboration, coherence, attitudes","The current article outlines a behavior-analytic approach to the study of socalled implicit attitudes and cognition. The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), the conceptual basis of which was derived from relational frame theory, is offered as a methodology that may be used in the experimental analysis of implicit attitudes and beliefs. The relational elaboration and coherence (REC) model provides a possible relational-frame account of the findings that have emerged from the IRAP. The article first outlines the research history that led to the development of the IRAP, followed by a description of the method. The REC model and how it explains a range of IRAP data are then considered. The article also outlines how both the IRAP and the REC model overlap with, and differ from, similar research found in the non-behavior-analytic literature. "
Brief report: The training and assessment of relational precursors and abilities (TARPA): A preliminary analysis,"Assessment. Relations, Relational frame theory, Correlation, Vineland, Generativity","The TARPA (Training & Assessment of Relational Precursors & Abilities) is a recently developed computer-based protocol for the assessment of a progression of key domains of responding critical to the development of generative language. In the current pilot study, five children with autism were assessed using the TARPA and their score on this protocol was correlated with ratings on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. Findings showed a statistically significant correlation. This and other features of TARPA performance and their implications for future testing and development of this protocol are discussed."
DERIVED RELATIONAL RESPONDING: A COMPARISON OF MATCH‐TO‐SAMPLE AND THE RELATIONAL COMPLETION PROCEDURE,"derived relational responding, match-to-sample, Relational Completion Procedure, relational frames, same, opposite, stimulus equivalence, adult humans","Previous research suggests that the Relational Completion Procedure may be an effective alternative procedure for studying derived relational responding. However, the parameters that make it effective, relative to traditional match-to-sample, remain to be determined. The present experiment compared the Relational Completion Procedure and match-to-sample protocols for training and testing Same and Opposite derived stimulus relations. Trials to criterion and overall pass rate (i.e., yield) in both procedures were compared across three variables: presence versus absence of a confirmatory response requirement, three versus five comparison stimuli, and top-to-bottom versus left-to-right presentation format. Findings demonstrated a facilitative effect of the confirmatory response requirement in both procedures. Training trials to criterion were nominally but not significantly lower during the nonarbitrary training phase in the Relational Completion Procedure compared to match-to-sample, and the overall yield on the arbitrary relational test was greater in the former procedure compared to the latter. The present findings support the further development of the Relational Completion Procedure as an efficient alternative procedure for establishing Same and Opposite relations with adult humans, and with potential applicability to other types of derived relations"
A relational frame training intervention to raise intelligence quotients: A pilot study.,"Relational Frame Theory, IQ, intelligence, relational training, multiple exemplar training","The current research consisted of 2 studies designed to test the effectiveness of automated multiple-exemplar relational training in raising children’s general intellectual skills. In Study 1, 4 participants were exposed to multiple exemplar training in stimulus equivalence and the relational frames of SAME, OPPOSITE, MORE THAN, and LESS THAN across several sessions and weeks. WISC (III-UK) measures were taken at baseline, following stimulus equivalence training, and again following relational frame training. Matched against a no-treatment control group, experimental participants showed significant improvements in full-scale IQ following stimulus equivalence training, and a further significant rise following relational frame training. Study 2 administered an improved multiple-exemplar-based relational frame training intervention to 8 children with a range of educational and behavioral difficulties. In 7 of the 8 cases, full-scale IQ as measured by the WISC (IV-UK) rose by at least 1 SD; the improvement was statistically significant at the group level. These data have important implications for the behavioral analysis of intellectual skills and suggest the basis of an intervention to improve general cognitive functioning."
Relational coherence in ambiguous and unambiguous relational networks,"Relational Frame Theory, derived stimulus relations, ambiguous relational networks, unambiguous relational networks, cognitive styles, cognitive errors","Clinical theories often appeal to general cognitive styles in explaining psychopathology, but without describing in detail how the patterns are formed. In the present investigation, two experiments were conducted to examine how individuals respond to ambiguous relational networks. In both experiments, the participants learned two 3-stimulus networks (A1 LESS THAN B1, A1 GREATER THAN C1 and A2 GREATER THAN B2, C2 LESS THAN A2). Participants were presented with test trials to examine if they classified the combinatorial relations (B1$ C1 and B2$C2) as SAME or DIFFERENT and as GREATER THAN or LESS THAN. Although the B–C combinatorial relation in Network 1 is derivable in a readily coherent way (B1 GREATER THAN C1 and thus also B1 DIFFERENT C1), in Network 2 the combinatorial relation is ambiguous. When participants were required to specify the Network 2 B–C relation as either SAME or DIFFERENT, those who chose DIFFERENT, also consistently chose B2 as either GREATER THAN or LESS THAN C2. Conversely, those who classified the B–C relation as SAME were inconsistent within themselves in choosing B2 as GREATER THAN or LESS THAN C2. In Experiment 2, nonarbitrary multiple exemplar pretraining was used to bias SAME versus DIFFERENT as a response for ambiguous combinatorial relations. In accord with the pattern seen in Experiment 1, those biased toward DIFFERENT consistently chose a comparative relation between B2 and C2 while those biased toward SAME were inconsistent in their comparative choices. The findings provide support for the importance of history and coherence in establishing patterns of responding to ambiguous relational networks, providing a beginning behavioral model of cognitive styles and errors."
The Training and Assessment of Relational Precursors and Abilities (TARPA): A follow-up study with typically developing children,"Assessment, Relational responding, Relational Frame Theory, Generativity, Generalization","The aim of this study was to probe the validity of the Training and Assessment of Relational Precursors and Abilities (TARPA) as a protocol for the measurement of relational skills underlying language in typically developing children. Seven children (5 girls and 2 boys aged 2–6 years) completed the visual– visual range of the TARPA at Time 1. Six of these children were re-assessed with the same protocol at Time 2. The Social Maturity Scale (S-M) was administered to the children’ caregivers. Results showed a significant correlation between performance on the TARPA and the Communication sub-scale of the S-M at Time 1. This result supports the use of the TARPA visual–visual range as a protocol for measuring responding critical to the development of generative verbal behavior. However, TARPA performances at Time 2 departed somewhat from our prediction. The latter patterns are discussed, together with implications for future testing and development of the protocol."
Establishing arbitrarily applicable relations of same and opposite with the relational completion procedure: Selection-based feedback,"derived relational responding, matching-to-sample, relational completion procedure, relational frames, same, opposite, adult humans","Research suggests that the relational completion procedure (RCP) is effective for studying derived relations of same and opposite. Previously, procedural parameters, such as the presence or absence of a confirmatory response requirement, were found to have a facilitative effect on the number of training trials to criterion and overall arbitrary test pass rate (i.e., yield). These experiments report on the manipulation of additional potentially important parameters—the presence or absence of selection-based feedback, 4 vs. 8 trial types and of a linked nonarbitrary and arbitrary training phase— across both the RCP and matching-to-sample (MTS) protocols with either 3 or 5 comparisons. During selection-based feedback, after the production of the confirmatory response, the sample, contextual cue, and selected comparison were presented along with corrective feedback. During the linked nonarbitrary–arbitrary phase, in the presence of the sample stimulus and the same and opposite contextual cues, respectively, selections of a nonarbitrary comparison stimulus at either end of a specified physical dimension were reinforced. Findings indicated a trend for improved performance with the inclusion of selection-based feedback and the linked nonarbitrary–arbitrary phase. There was a significant difference in yield between the RCP and MTS conditions (84% vs. 56%, respectively). The implications of the findings for contemporary research on derived relational responding are discussed."
Constructing Relational Sentences: Establishing Arbitrarily AppliCable Comparative Relations with the Relational Completion Procedure.,"arbitrarily applicable comparative relations, More Than, Less Than, Relational Completion Procedure, constructed response, linear, adults","The present study examined the effectiveness of the Relational Completion Procedure (RCP) in establishing arbitrarily applicable comparative relations after training with either linear (Experiment 1) or non-linear (Experiment 2) arbitrary relations. Linear relations were those presented in a sequential order (i.e., A-B, B-C, C-D, etc.), while nonlinear relations were presented in a nonsequential order (i.e., C-D, B-C, A-B, etc.). After nonarbitrary relational training and testing to establish the contextual functions of MORE THAN and LESS THAN, adults underwent constructed-response nonarbitrary relational training and testing with physically dissimilar stimuli in which they were required to “complete” relational sentences in the presence of the cues. Next, during arbitrary relational training with abstract stimuli, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 training groups: All-More (E > D, D > C., C > B, and B > A), All-Less (A < B, B < C., C < D, and D < E), and Less-More (A < B, B < C., D > C., and E > D). Finally, during arbitrary relational testing, probes for mutually entailed relations were followed by probes for 1-and 2-node combinatorially entailed relations. The yield, or percentage of participants passing, was 83% in Experiment 1 and 91.6% in Experiment 2. Our findings demonstrate that the RCP was successful in establishing arbitrarily applicable comparative relations with adults regardless of the order in which the arbitrary relational training trials were presented."
Assessing the relationship between intelligence and the PEAK relational training system,"ABA therapy, Intelligence quotient, Language, Verbal behavior therapy","The Promoting the Emergence of Advanced Knowledge (PEAK) Relational Training System is an assessment and curriculum tool developed for basic and advanced skills using behavior analytic approaches. The current study evaluated the relationship between intelligence (as measured by IQ scores) and performance on the PEAK assessment with children with autism or other developmental and intellectual disabilities. Each child was administered the PEAK assessment from the Direct Training Module. Scores from this assessment were compared to IQ scores for all participants to assess the relationship between the two measures. Results indicated a strong, significant correlation between scores on standardized IQ tests and scores on the PEAK assessment (r = .759, p < .01). The results demonstrated strong convergent validity and indicate that the PEAK may be a useful assessment and curriculum guide for training language and learning skills to individuals with autism and other developmental disabilities.

Relational ability and language performance in children with autism spectrum disorders and typically developing children: A further test of the TARPA protocol,"TARPA , Autism spectrum disorder, PLS-4, Language, Relational frame theory","The Training and Assessment of Relational Precursors and Abilities (TARPA) protocol was developed to assess the emergence of derived relational responding, which has been argued by relational frame theory (RFT) to be the key process underlying language. Previous research showed a correlation between the TARPA and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) in several children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The current study advanced this work by correlating a more comprehensive and systematic TARPA protocol with the Preschool Language Scale, Fourth Edition (PLS-4), a mainstream performance-based language assessment, in 10 additional children with ASD (Experiment 1) and 13 typically developing children (Experiment 2). This study also involved a hierarchical analysis of the TARPA. Results showed (a) a strong and significant correlation between the TARPA and PLS-4 full scale and subscales, and (b) evidence to support the hierarchical structure of the TARPA. The implications of these and other findings are discussed."
PEAK Relational Training System for Children with Autism and Developmental Disabilities: Correlations with Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and Assessment Reliability,"ABA therapy, Discrete trial training, Verbal behavior therapy, Language training","The present investigation sought to explore initial psychometric properties of the PEAK Relational Training System—Module 1: Direct Training for children with autism. Thirteen children diagnosed with autism or related disorders were exposed to an initial assessment designed to evaluate skill deficits within their repertoire, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the Illinois Early Learning Standards Test. Additionally, staff performances were evaluated on reliability of delivery of the PEAK assessment. Results yielded significant positive correlations among the obtained PEAK assessment scores, the Peabody and the Standards assessments. Implications for evidence-based discrete trial training curricula are discussed."
Using the T-IRAP interactive computer program and applied behavior analysis to teach relational responding in children with autism,"autism, t-irap, drr, computerised interactive teaching, flexibility","The irap computer software program was adapted as an interactive teaching tool (t-irap) targeting relational frames with four children with diagnosed autism aged 8–10 years. An adaptation of a multiple-baseline design was used to compare participants’ relational learning in terms of speed and accuracy during Table-Top (tt) and t-irap teaching. The tt procedure was commenced with all participants simultaneously, and the t-irap was introduced at stepwise time intervals (after 5, 10, 15, 20 trial blocks) across the four participants. Nonarbitrary then arbitrary coordination, comparative, opposition and derived relations were targeted. Results showed that the t-irap was successfully adapted to teach all targeted relations, and in general greater speed and accuracy in relational responding were shown for all four participants during t-irap teaching compared with tt teaching. Thus the t-irap may be a useful supplementary teaching tool in applied settings."
Facilitating relational framing in children and individuals with developmental delay using the relational completion procedure,"derived relational responding, relational completion procedure, autism spectrum disorder, mouse click, touch screen, humans","The Relational Completion Procedure is effective for establishing same, opposite and comparative derived relations in verbally able adults, but to date it has not been used to establish relational frames in young children or those with developmental delay. In Experiment 1, the Relational Completion Procedure was used with the goal of establishing two 3-member sameness networks in nine individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (eight with language delay). A multiple exemplar intervention was employed to facilitate derived relational responding when required. Seven of nine participants in Experiment 1 passed tests for derived relations. In Experiment 2, eight participants (all of whom, except one, had a verbal repertoire) were given training with the aim of establishing two 4-member sameness networks. Three of these participants were typically developing young children aged between 5 and 6 years old, all of whom demonstrated derived relations, as did four of the five participants with developmental delay. These data demonstrate that it is possible to reliably establish derived relations in young children and those with developmental delay using an automated procedure."
Correlating derived relational responding with linguistic and cognitive ability in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders,"Derived relations, TARPA, PLS-4, SB5, Autism Spectrum Disorder","Many children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) show substantial deficits in linguistic and cognitive ability. When considered from the perspective of Relational Frame Theory (RFT), it is possible that these deficits are rooted in a deficiency in the capacity to derive relations. One key aim of the Training and Assessment of Relational Precursors and Abilities (TARPA) protocol is to assess derived relational responding. A number of previous studies have shown correlations between TARPA performance and linguistic ability in children with ASD. The current study has extended this work by (i) showing correlations between TARPA performance and cognitive as well as linguistic ability in a larger (n = 35) sample of children with ASD; (ii) providing evidence of TARPA test–retest reliability; (iii) providing additional evidence indicating differences in visual and auditory performance in children with ASD."
The effect of relational training on intelligence quotient: A case study,"Relational frame theory, Intelligence, Multiple-exemplartraining,Derived relational responding","Background: Relational training protocols based on Relational Frame Theory (RFT) are showing promising results in increasing intelligence quotient. This case study aimed at analyzing the effect of a training protocol in fl uency and fl exibility in relational responding on intelligence quotient with a 4-year-old child. Method: The child’s cognitive and psychomotor development was evaluated before and after the implementation of the training protocol using the McCarthy’s Aptitudes and Psychomotricity Scale (MSCA). The training protocol consisted of a multiple-exemplar-training (MET) in relational framing in accordance with COORDINATION (Phases 1 and 2), OPPOSITION (Phase 3 and 4), and COMPARISON (Phases 5 and 6). The MET protocol was implemented in approximately 12 hours throughout fi ve and one half months. Results: The training was effective in establishing relational responding in OPPOSITION and COMPARISON frames as well as in promoting fl uency and fl exibility in all the three types of trained relations. After this training, the child showed an increase above 1.5 SD in the General Cognitive Index of the MSCA (from 106 to 131). Conclusions: This case study adds further empirical evidence of the potential of RFT training to improve cognitive abilities and intelligence."
Mutual Entailment of Temporal Relations in Younger and Older Adults: Reversing Order Judgments. ,"Stimulus relations, Age, Relational flexibility, Mutual entailment","For temporal relations, mutually entailed relations are different to those directly trained; we learn that A occurred “before” B and derive that B occurred “after” A. Deriving such relations results in lower accuracy and slower response speeds compared to derived relations identical to those trained. The ability of an individual to derive relations different to those trained is a measure of relational flexibility and predicts performance on standard cognitive tests. In the current study, 23 younger (M = 19 years) and 23 older (M = 61 years) participants observed pairs of stimuli presented consecutively (A … B) and then evaluated statements including the stimuli in the same (A BEFORE B) or reversed order (B AFTER A). Judgements on reversed (“after”) statements resulted in lower accuracy and slower response speeds than those presented in the same order (“before”) for both older and younger groups. Older adults exhibited deficits in relational flexibility compared to younger adults, such as slower progression through experimental phases, particularly in correctly responding to reversed statements. Older participants also demonstrated higher error rates on foil statements and responded more slowly than younger participants. The findings suggest that older adults may benefit from training strategies focused on relational flexibility"
A relational frame skills training intervention to increase general intelligence and scholastic aptitude,"Relational frame theory, Relational skills, Derived relational responding, Intelligence, Educational Aptitude","This study aimed to replicate and extend the pilot findings of Cassidy et al. (2011) which found that teaching children to derive various relations among stimuli leads to increases in the full scale IQ scores of both typically developing children and those with educational and learning difficulties. In Experiment 1, fifteen 11-12 year old children were exposed over several months to an intensive training intervention to improve their understanding of the relations Same, Opposite and More and Less. Significant increases in full scale IQ of around one standard deviation were recorded for each child. In Experiment 2, the same intervention was delivered to thirty 15-17 year old children. Significant increases in verbal and numerical reasoning were recorded for almost every child. These findings corroborate the idea that relational skills may underlie many forms of general cognitive ability. "
Comparing the effects of derived relational training and computer coding on intellectual potential in school‐age children,"Intelligence, Derived relational responding, SMART, Scratch, Relational frame theory","Background. Previous research found that pre-teenage ability to derive arbitrary ‘same’, ‘opposite’, ‘more’, and ‘less’ relations correlated with measured intelligence quotient (IQ) and that training this derived relational responding (DRR) skill produced substantial IQ rises. Aims. This study extended previous work by comparing the effects of DRR training (using strengthening mental abilities with relational training [SMART], an automated online training protocol) with the effects of a similar quantity of training in ‘Scratch’ computer coding. Sample. Twenty-eight children (13 girls) aged 10–11 (M = 10.34) participated, all members of the same class in a primary school in Co. Limerick, Ireland. Methods. Participants were tested before and after training for DRR ability as well as on standardized tests of IQ and academic attainment. Training time was limited to 29 hrs over two academic semesters in twice-weekly 1-hr instalments. Results. Significant improvements were seen in measures of overall intellectual performance; in digit span and letter/number sequencing; and in academic attainment, including spelling, reading, and numerical operations, in the SMART/DRR group alone, and there was significantly more improvement on these measures in the SMART/DRR group than in the Scratch group. Conclusions. These findings extend the evidence that training DRR can produce improvements in intellectual and academic ability."
"Relational frame theory, mathematical and logical skills: A multiple exemplar training intervention to enhance intellectual performance","RFT, multiple exemplar training, relational responding, mathematical skills, intelligence","The current study investigated the effects of Relational Frame Theory (RFT) based training on mathematical and logical skills. A sample of 21 Swedish high school students attending first grade and second grade were assigned to either training (n= 10) or notraining conditions (n= 11). Measures of performance on mathematical tests, Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM), and relational responding tasks were taken prior to and after training. For 8-10 weeks, the experimental group trained using SMART, an online multiple exemplar training program for enhancing relational skills. No significant differences between the groups were found on mathematical performance. A significant increase on SPM performance was observed for the experimental group. The findings are in line with previous research on RFT, suggesting that behaviorally based interventions can enhance intellectual performance. Population characteristics, SMART training procedures, strengths and methodological limitations are discussed."
Assessing and Training Young Children in Same and Different Relations Using the Relational Evaluation Procedure (REP),"Relational frame theory (RFT), Relational evaluation procedure (REP), Children, Assessment, Training, Multiple baseline design","Previous research suggests the relational evaluation procedure (REP) is a useful means by which to assess and train relational responding. Most work so far has been with adults; however, given the potential utility of the REP for assessing and training relational responding, researchers need to investigate its use with young children. The current series of studies presents relevant data. Study 1 shows correlations between performance on a simple REP-based multi-level protocol (the NSD-REP) and cognitive and linguistic ability in a relatively large (n = 26) sample of typically developing children (aged 2–5). Studies 2–4 involved training REP performance to criterion in a number of these children, using a multiple baseline design across participants in each case to show experimental control. These findings supplement previous data suggesting the utility of the REP for training relational responding in young children."
Assessing and training children with autism spectrum disorder using the relational evaluation procedure,"relational frame theory (RFT), relational evaluation procedure (REP), children, autism, multiple baseline design, assessment","The relational evaluation procedure (REP) is seen by proponents of relational frame theory (RFT) as a useful means by which to assess and train relational responding. Most REP work so far has been conducted with typically developing adults; however, given the importance of relational responding as a repertoire and of the potential utility of the REP for assessing and training this repertoire, researchers need to investigate its use with other populations including children with autism and other developmental delay. The current study presents relevant data. Nine children were initially assessed using a simple REP-based multilevel protocol (the NSD-REP) and on a measure of linguistic ability (Pre-school Language Scale, 4th Edition; PLS4). Three children found to pass Level 1 (same and different relations) but not Level 2 (affirmation and disconfirmation of same and different relations) were subsequently given a training intervention in the latter using a multiple baseline design. These findings supplement previous data suggesting the utility of the REP for training relational responding in children with autism."
The impact of arbitrarily applicable relational responding on evaluative learning about hypothetical money and shock outcomes,"relational responding, arbitrary stimulus relations, more than and less than, evaluative learning, reversal","Evaluative learning comprises changes in preferences after co-occurrences between conditioned stimuli (CSs) and an unconditioned stimulus (US) of affective value. Such co-occurrences may involve relational responding. Two experiments were conducted on the impact of arbitrary relational responding on evaluative preferences for hypothetical money and shock outcomes. In Experiment 1, participants were trained to make arbitrary relational responses by placing CSs of the same size but different colours (A, B and C) into boxes according to the following instructions: “B is bigger than A” and “C is bigger than B”. They were then instructed that these CSs represented different intensities of hypothetical USs (money or shock). Results showed that liking ratings of the CSs were altered in accordance with the underlying bigger than or smaller than relations. A reversal of preference was also observed such that the CS associated with the smallest hypothetical shock was rated more positively than the CS associated with the smallest amount of hypothetical money. In Experiment 2, we employed training and testing procedures from Relational Frame Theory (RFT) to establish a relational network of comparative (more than/less than) relations consisting of five CSs (A-B-C-D-E). Overall, evaluative preferences were altered, but not reversed, depending on (a) how stimuli had been related to one another during the learning phase and (b) whether those stimuli referred to money or shocks. The use of RFT as a framework to study relational learning effects in evaluative learning is discussed."
Teaching important relational skills for children with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability using freely available (GO-IRAP) software. ,,"The current article is a brief summary of recent research in relational responding with an emphasis on the Ghent Odysseus Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (GO-IRAP) for teaching this important skill to children with diagnosed autism. Relational responding, especially derived (emergent, untaught) relational responding is thought to be related to complex human cognition such as language and other symbolic understanding (e.g., algebra, maths). Research has indicated that fluent and flexible relational responding is correlated with higher scores on standardized ability/ IQ tests, and that even quite complex relational skills may be taught to children with autism using Multiple Exemplar Training (MET) with other behavioural principles such as positive reinforcement. The GO-IRAP is an interactive computerised teaching programme conceptualized by Professor Dermot Barnes-Holmes and colleagues, which has been made freely available to practitioners and parents. This is a teaching tool designed to assess and teach relational responding from basic nonarbitrary/ physically-based relations such as coordination (same-different), comparison (greater-lesser), opposition, temporal (before-after, hierarchy, deictic relations (I-YOU), and arbitrary relations (.50=50%; X=Y) including Derived Relational Responding (DRR; teach A is greater-than B and B is greater-than, test if child derives (untaught) B is smaller than A, C is smaller than A, A is bigger than C). The current article provides some examples of the diverse relations that can be taught, and stimuli and feedback that can be presented; notably, ongoing research with the GO-IRAP may bring further refinements."
Arbitrarily applicable spatial relational responding ,"spatial relations, relational frame theory, nonarbitrary, arbitrary, reversal, humans","Spatial reasoning, where novel spatial relationships are inferred based on trained relationships, can be conceptualized as arbitrarily applicable spatial relational responding. Here, we conducted two experiments to develop and validate, for the first time, a laboratory procedure to establish arbitrarily applicable spatial relational responding in adult humans. In Experiment 1, participants were trained on nonarbitrary spatial relational tasks designed to establish contextual cues for left of, right of, above, and below. Contextual cues were then used to train a series of arbitrary spatial relations involving four abstract shapes. Following training in a subset of arbitrary relations (A is left of B, B is above C, C is right of D), subsequent testing examined the emergence of untrained spatial relations (B is right of A, C is below B, D is left of C, D is below A and A is above D). When absent in initial tests, spatial relational responding was facilitated by a remedial training procedure incorporating nonarbitrary relational guidance. Participants showed patterns of spatial relational responding consistent with test relations. In Experiment 2, a variant reversal design yielded predictable, reversed spatial relational responses. Overall, the present procedures represent the first empirical demonstration of arbitrarily applicable spatial relational responding and thus, arguably, the first functional analytic model of spatial reasoning."
Facilitating relational framing of classification in young children,"relational frame theory,  hierarchy, containment, language, classification, combined multiple baseline design","The current research aimed to assess and train relational framing of categorization in young typically developing children and to assess the impact of training on relevant measures of language and categorization. In two experiments, children were assessed and trained in mutual and combinatorial entailment and transformation of function. In Experiment 1, five year olds were assessed and trained in arbitrary containment while in Experiment 2 six year olds were assessed and trained in arbitrary hierarchy. Both experiments employed a multiple baseline design across responses and participants and compared children receiving training with controls. In both experiments, correct responding increased to criterion levels on introduction of training, and both generalization and maintenance was observed. In both cases, the training group showed better performance than controls on related measures. Results are discussed in relation to previous research and for implications with regard to future studies on relational framing and categorization in children. "
Reversing Time and Size: Mutual Entailment of Nonarbitrary Temporal and Magnitude Relational Respondin,"Relational frame theory, Relational responding, Nonarbitrary relations, Temporal relations, Magnitude relations, Sequence","Responding to temporal relational statements that include the original events (e.g., A. .. B) in a reversed order (e.g., “B after A”) is less accurate and more time-consuming than responding to such statements when they retain the original order of presentation (e.g., “A before B”). The current study assessed whether this effect was limited to temporal relational responding by estimating the effect of reversal on magnitude statements (e.g., “B bigger than A”) as well as temporal statements. Participants (N = 40) completed temporal and magnitude relational judgement tasks in blocks consisting of a training phase and a testing phase. The order of relational tasks was counterbalanced across participants; participants learned the second type of relational task faster than the first. During testing, reversal of the order of stimuli in both temporal and magnitude relations reduced accuracy and increased response latencies suggesting that the reversal effect was not limited to temporal relations. The findings support the position that a general relational effect, such as mutual entailment, may underlie the increased difficulty of reversed temporal relational statements."
Assessing the effects of a relational training intervention on fluid intelligence among a sample of socially disadvantaged children in Bangladesh,"Relational reasoning, Intelligence, Applied learning theory","A growing consensus is that performances on standardized intelligence tests can be positively influenced by interventions that focus on improving relational reasoning. One such intervention, known as SMART (Strengthening Mental Abilities with Relational Training), consists of presenting participants with increasingly complex exemplars of relational reasoning tasks involving premises associated along same-as, opposite-of, more-than, and less-than relations. Following multiple training and testing sessions involving these relations, increased fluency in SMART is related to enhanced performances on tests of intellectual ability (Cassidy et al., 2016). The current study expands upon previous investigations on SMART in two ways. First, we explored whether the amount of training undertaken can predict changes in intelligence test performances. Second, we assessed whether SMART training could be effective for a non-English speaking, socioeconomically disadvantaged cohort. Changes in intelligence were assessed via administrations of the standard Raven’s Progressive Matrices before and after SMART training. Our results show that the stage of SMART training completed is positively related to changes in Ravens’ performances and that such training can be effective for non-English cohorts."
Piloting a brief relational operant training program: analyses of response latencies and intelligence test performance,"SMART training, analogy, derived relational responding, response latencies, intelligence, relational frame theory","Previous research suggests that training relational operant responding using the SMART (Strengthening Mental Abilities with Relational Training) program over several months can result in improved performance on cognitive intelligence tests. This study aimed to investigate whether engaging in a 3-week relational training program would improve (i) scores and (ii) reaction times on a standardised intelligence test, and (iii) to pilot a new multiple exemplar training procedure targeting complex analogical operant responding (SMARTA; SMART for Analogy). We administered the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT-2) to eight adults across four time points. Control: Time 1–4: No intervention. Experimental: Time 1–2: No intervention. Time 2–3: SMART relational operant training. Time 3–4: SMARTA analogical relational operant training. Experimental participants demonstrated greater improvements in terms of both (i) response latencies and (ii) response fluencies on the Verbal Knowledge subscale of the KBIT2."
Symbolic Generalization of Discriminative Functions in Accordance with a Five-Member Comparative Relational Network,"Symbolic generalization, Transformation of functions, Comparative, Morethan/lessthan, Discriminative functions, Humans","Three experiments investigated the symbolic generalization (transformation) of discriminative (bar-pressing) functions in accordance with a five-member arbitrary relational comparative network (A–B–C–D–E) in adults. Following nonarbitrary relational training and testing to establish the contextual functions of MORE-THAN and LESS-THAN for two abstract images, participants received arbitrary relational training and testing. One group received training on “More-than” baseline relations (e.g., B > A, C > B, D > C, and E > D) and another group received training on “Less-than” baseline relations (A < B < C < D < E). Both groups were then tested on a combination of “More-than” and “Less-than” relations (e.g., C > A and A < C, etc.) and exposed to a barpress training phase, which trained a low, steady rate bar-pressing response function to the middle stimulus (C) in the relational network. In Experiment 1, testing involved a quasi-random order of presentation of probe stimuli and half of the participants responded in accordance with the predicted relational network (i.e., pressed less to A and B and more to D and E, than to C). In Experiment 2, none of the participants showed the predicted performance when the probe stimuli were presented in a fixed order (A–B–C–D–E), whereas three out of four participants in Experiment 3 responded in accordance with the predicted relational network when the test was repeated. These findings indicate the importance of identifying methodological factors that may potentially influence the symbolic generalization of discriminative functions."
Relational operant skills training increases standardized matrices scores in adolescents: A stratified active-controlled trial,"SMART training, Relational frame theory, Personality, Matrices, Processing speed, Cognitive ability, Brain training","In recent years, small-scale studies have suggested that we may be able to substantially strengthen children’s general cognitive abilities and intelligence quotient (IQ) scores using a relational operant skills training program (SMART). Only one of these studies to date has included an active Control Condition, and that study reported the smallest mean IQ rise. The present study is a larger stratifed activecontrolled trial to independently test the utility of SMART training for raising Nonverbal  IQ (NVIQ) and processing speed. We measured personality traits, NVIQs, and processing speeds of a cohort of school pupils (aged 12–15). Participants were allocated to either a SMART intervention group or a Scratch computer coding control group, for a period of 3 months. We reassessed pupils’ NVIQs and processing speeds after the 3-month intervention. We observed a signifcant mean increase in the SMART training group’s (fnal nexp=43) NVIQs of 5.98 points, while there was a nonsignifcant increase of 1.85 points in the Scratch active-control group (fnal ncont=27). We also observed an increase in processing speed across both conditions (fnal nexp=70; ncont=55) over Time. Our results suggest that relational skills training may be useful for improving performance on matrices tasks, and perhaps in future, accelerating children’s progression toward developmental milestones."
Non-verbal IQ Gains from Relational Operant Training Explain Variance in Educational Attainment: An Active-Controlled Feasibility Study,"SMART training, Relational frame theory, Personality, School examinations, Cognitive ability, Cognitive training","Research suggests that training relational operant patterns of behavior can lead to increases in general cognitive ability and educational outcomes. Most studies to date have been under-powered and included proxy measures of educational attainment. We attempted to extend previous findings with increased experimental control in younger children (aged 6.9–10.1 years). Participants (N = 49) were assigned to either a relational training or chess control group. Over 5 months, teachers assigned class time to complete either relational training or play chess. Those who were assigned relational training gained 8.9 non-verbal IQ (NVIQ) points, while those in the control condition recorded no gains (dppc2 = .99). Regression analyses revealed that posttraining NVIQ predicted reading test scores (conducted approximately 1 month later) over and above baseline NVIQ in the experimental condition only, consistent with what we might expect in a full test of far transfer towards educational outcomes."
